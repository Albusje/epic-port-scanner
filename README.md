# epic-port-scanner
Scan the given ports from given address
REMINDER:
Scanning ports without permission is no way acceptable. In any circumstances use only with permission and at own risk.
Didn't want to put it here first, but I kinda need a place to hold small simple codes.

This one particular code gave me inspiration about CyberSec. It's a very simple way to "sniff" ports from designated address/host.
During the search, software prints out found ports one by one.

Especially, for the base of this software credits goes to F-Secure.
